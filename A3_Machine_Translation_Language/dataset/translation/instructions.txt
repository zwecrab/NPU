# INSTRUCTIONS FOR TRANSLATION QA
#
# There are 100 sentence blocks in this file. Each block has the following format.
# - First line for sequence number, 
# - Second line for English source sentence
# - Third line for Myanmar translation -- You can overwrite it with your correction.
# - Fourth line for the rating of final translation between (1-5) -- This is for you to add.
# - Fifth line is a blank line for sepearating between the blocks
#
#  QA PROCEDURE:
#  1. Do not add or remove any lines to this file (except for comments/notes that start with a #)
#  2. Comments are optional translation notes for anything you want to discuss with the wider group.
#     Any number of lines for comments (notes) can be added to the block by starting with a Hash #.    
#  3. Do not correct the English sentence under any circumstances.
#  4. Correct the Myanmar Translation if it is mistranslated, or can be improved.
#     To correct, just overwrite the Myanmar sentence. DO NOT keep older versions of Myanmar Translation.
#  5. Give a translation quality rating to the final version of the Myanmar sentence.
#
#     Translation rating is out of 5
#         5/5 = Translation is perfect
#         4/5 = Translation is somewhat unnatural, but the overall meaning is correct
#         3/5 = Translation is partially correct, but missing some details
#         2/5 = Translation is wrong or misleading
#         1/5 = Translation is incomprehensible.
# 
# GENERAL TRANSLATION GUIDANCE:
#   1. Don't miss any information in translation
#   2. Don't add unnecessary information
#   3. Take care to minimise spelling mistakes in Myanmar sentence
#   4. Use the spoken or written style of Myanmar, depending on the English sentence (e.g. သည်၊ မည်၊ vs. တယ်၊ မယ်)
#   5. If possible, use the Myanmar terms that directly align to English (i.e. avoid idiomatic translation)
#
# HOW TO HANDLE SPECIAL CASES:        
#   1. English Terms: 
#      If there is no commonly used Burmese word for an English term, just use the English words back in Myanmar Translation
#      For example, it is OK to translate "England" as "အင်္ဂလန်" becuase the word exists in Burmese Literature.
#      But names like "James Whitcomb Riley, Eugene V. Debs and Madam C.J" should be just used as-is in English in the translation.
#      Likewise, for uncommon English words, it is OK to use them as English in the Translation.
#
#   2. Mistranslations due to cultural difference
#     For example, "Indians" can refer to Native Indians, rather than အိန္ဒိယလူမျိုး that is closer to Burmese culture.
#     If you are not sure, just use the English word "Indians"
#
#   3. Present Tense / Past Tense correctness
#     Look out for mistakes in tenses. e.g. Go/Went/Gone = သွားသည်/သွားခဲ့သည်/သွားပြီးပြီ 
#
# The first 5 blocks have been already completed for you as an example. Start from the 6th block.
# Don't worry if it is too hard to get the perfect translation. Just try to improve it. 
# It is good enough if your FINAL translations can get to (4/5) rating.
